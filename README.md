### Description
In this Kaggle competition, we’re challenged to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s current models. We’ll be using a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.
Disclaimer: the dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.

### Course Objectives
The course targets text analytics systems and applications to respond to business problems by discovering and presenting knowledge that is otherwise locked in textual form. The objective is to learn to recognize situations in which text analytics techniques can solve information processing needs, to identify the analytic task/process that best models the business problem, to select the most appropriate resources methods and tools, to collect text data and apply such methods to them. Several applications context will be presented: information extraction, sentiment analysis (what is the nature of commentary on an issue), spam and fake posts detection, quantification problems, summarization, etc.
